    "The CBD,  or cannabidiol, market is a fast growing market which offers CBD in a broad range of products. Well-known product forms are oils/tinctures, lotions/balms, and gummies. Less well-known CBD infused products are bedsheets, bath bombs, and dog treats. According to Consumer Reports (2019) CBD products are primarily used to reduce stress/anxiety and joint pain (61%), and insomnia (10%). Recreational use comprises 10% of CBD use. The Brightfield Group (2017) expects the CBD market to grow to $25 billion by 2025, up from 4.67 million in 2017. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently the leading the market is California, CA  (Statista, 2021). Our client, a medium sized CBD seller with a broad range of products, has decided to open a store in San Francisco, CA. The company asked us to make a data driven recommendation for 3 possible areas that fall within the following guidelines (in order of importance):\n",
    "1. The preferred area is a cluster of neighborhoods, although a single neighborhood is not rejected beforehand.\n",
    "2. The dominant age group in the area is 20 -34 year (33% of CBD-only product users).\n",
    "3. The area has enough businesses to attract people that are interested health and/or are looking for fun. Examples are organic restaurants and shops, pharmacies with CBD, vitamins and supplements on their shelves, coffeeshops, restaurants and/or nightlife.\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of the recommendation is laid in the 'Data' section of this report. Here the report shows how the gathered data was cleaned and prepared. Following the methodology described in the 'Methodology' section, the 'Analysis' section reports on the data analysis. Finally, after the findings and recommendation are discussed in the 'Results and Discussion' section, final remarks are made in the 'Conclusion'."
